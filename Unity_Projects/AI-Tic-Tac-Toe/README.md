# Tic Tac Toe vs AI bot using Unity
This project is a Tic Tac Toe game where the player plays versus an AI bot game and the user can choose one of 3 difficulties. Easy, medium, and hard, in easy the bot might choose the correct move, while in the medium difficulty the bo will choose a better move and try to win with fewer moves, as for hard the bot will always choose the best move so it's either the bot win or make the user not win which makes it impossible for the user to win.
The AI algorithm used is minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning technique, built with unity game engine and C#.
